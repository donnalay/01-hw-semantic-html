# Challenge: WanderNote ‚Äî Convert Divs to Semantic HTML

## Objective

You are given a **div-heavy** 2010s-style page. Convert it into a clean, accessible, **semantic HTML** layout
while **preserving the visual design** (CSS already targets ids/classes so your semantic swap won't break).

## Tasks

1. Open `Unsolved/index.html` and **replace structural `<div>` elements** with semantic tags:
   - `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`
2. Keep class/id names the same so existing CSS continues to work.
3. Add meaningful `alt` text to images and accessible link text.
4. Ensure headings follow a logical order (e.g., one `<h1>`, then `<h2>` for sections).

## Acceptance Criteria

- Visual layout remains intact.
- Semantic elements used appropriately.
- All images have meaningful `alt` attributes.
- Headings are logical and accessible.

> **Note:** Plain selectors only this week. No pseudo-classes required.

## Proposed Solution

- Converted element tags to use semantic tags where relevant.
- Re-ordered elements where relevant to meet semantic element patterns.
- Introduced new elements in opportunities to provide more semantic meaning and structure (e.g. figure and figcaption).
- Updated #left-panel to include css style for spacing inbetween child card elements.
- Updated figure element to remove margin and enable post-img to take up more width within a card for improved visual alignment.
- Adjusted size and crop of the hero-img to reduce scroll to additional sections.
- Updated tag link style to be consistent with nav link style.

## Questions

- When to use a section vs. a div?
  - A section defines a self-contained block of content and should include a header, whereas a div has no semantic meaning and is more commonly used for layout and visual organization.
- Should <figcaption> text be wrapped in a <p> tag?
  - No, it should not be wrapped in a p tag.
